It's really a pain to do this.  The file that you want is TheExposure.pem.
It is made by concatenating the Certificate and Key pems into a single file.
The Key pem is from your APNS private key in the "login" keychain in Keychain Access.
The Cert pem is from you certificate - also in the "login" keychain in Keychain Access.
